# Mutah API Documentation

Last reviewed: 2026-08-24

## Base URL

Local XAMPP:

```text
http://localhost/Mutah/public/api/v1
```

Laravel development server:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1
```


https://mutaah-api.apps.taqat.academy/api/v1/

Replace the base URL with the deployed domain in production.

## Authentication

Public endpoints do not require authentication.

Protected endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
Accept: application/json
```

The token is returned by `register` and `login` in the `access_token` field.

Admin endpoints require a token belonging to a user whose `role` is `admin`.

## Standard Response Format

Successful responses generally include:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {}
}
```

Validation errors return HTTP `422`. Unauthorized requests return HTTP `401` or `403`. Conflict operations return HTTP `409`.

## 1. Authentication and Password Reset

### Register

```http
POST /register
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
    "full_name": "Ahmed Salem",
    "username": "ahmed_salem",
    "email": "ahmed@example.com",
    "phone": "0599111111",
    "governorate": "gaza",
    "district": "Al Rimal",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123",
    "terms": true
}
```

Governorates:

```text
north, gaza, middle, khanyonis, rafah
```

The response returns a Sanctum token. New users start on the Standard plan.

### Login

```http
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
    "login": "ahmed_salem",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

`login` accepts either username or email.

### Logout

```http
POST /logout
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Forgot Password

```http
POST /forgot-password
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
    "email": "ahmed@example.com"
}
```

The API sends a reset notification if the email exists. The response intentionally does not reveal whether an email is registered.

### Reset Password

```http
POST /reset-password
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
    "email": "ahmed@example.com",
    "token": "TOKEN_FROM_EMAIL",
    "password": "newpassword123",
    "password_confirmation": "newpassword123"
}

The token is valid for 60 minutes. Existing Sanctum tokens are revoked after a successful reset.
